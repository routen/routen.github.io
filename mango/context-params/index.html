        <p>Sometimes you need to have slightly different logic deployed to different parts of your user base.</p>
        
        <p>Most typically this would be along geographic lines: perhaps in one part of the country your users must apply a slightly
        different procedure than in other parts of the country.</p>
        
        <p>To achieve this context-sensitive behaviour in an app, you can make use of Context Parameters</p>

          <p>A "Context Parameter" is a parameter defined within a Deployment and which can be assigned different values for each Deployment Group
        </p>

        <h2>Select the Parameter to View Values</h2>
        <p>
        
        The parameter you just created will appear in the list of "Group Context Parameters". 
        </p>
        
        <p/>
        Now, if you select the parameter, to the right will appear the Groups hierarchy defined in your Deployment. 
        <p/>
        If you had
        already given values to this parameter, the values would appear beside the group names.

        <p/>
        
        <h2>Select a Group and (Re-)Assign a Value</h2>
        <p/>
        Now, add a value for a Group by doing this:
        <ul>
            <li>After selecting the Context Parameter "raincoat", select a Group from the hierarchy which appears on the right</li>
             <li>An input box will appear above the Groups into which you can enter the value of the parameter for the group selected </li>
             <li>Enter a value</li>
               <li>Click Update button to save the value for that Group.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <aside class="special"><p>In the image 
            below we have selected the "raincoat" parameter and are entering the value "yes" for the "Facility Cloudy" Group</p></aside>

        <p/>

        <h2>Values are Inherited</h2>
        <p/>
         You might not want to assign values to individual Groups but instead assign values at a higher level in the hierarchy
        and have any sub-groups take the same value.
        <p/>
        This is possible. In the example below, we have selected "South District" and given the value "no". This has been inherited 
        by all Groups (and users) within South District.
        
         <p/>
        <img src="inherit-values.png" style="max-width: 643px">
        
        <p/>
        
         <h2>Values can be Overridden</h2>
        <p/>
        But, having assigned a default for a district or region like that, we can nevertheless assign a specific value to a Group in that
        hierarchy and thereby override that default value (as shown here, where we have overridden the "no" for South District for the Facility
        Lowland)
        <p/>
         <img src="override-values.png" style="max-width: 643px">

      <google-codelab-step label="Read Value in a Process" duration="3">
        
        So now we have defined a Context Parameter called "raincoat" and assigned values to that parameter for each Group.
          
          <p/>
          How do we use this in an App to make the behaviour sensitive to the user's location?
          <p/>
          There is a special Action type which reads the value of a Context Parameter into a variable (called a Context Variable).
          After that, we can use the value of that Context Variable just like any other variable value<p/>
          
        <h2>Add Context Variable Action</h2>
        
        <p/>
          <ul>
            <li>Go into a Process in which you want to use the context-dependent values you have defined.</li>
               <li>Select to add a "Create Context Variable" Action</li>
          </ul>
        <p/>
        <img src="add-action.png" style="max-width: 600px">
        
        
        <p/>
        
        <h2>Indicate Parameter name in action</h2>
        
         <p/>
        Here, you are defining a variable, so you have to provide a variable name as usual.
          <p/>
          But you also need to give the name of the Context Parameter, since this variable will, when the app
          is used, have whichever value you have assigned to the Group of the user.
        
        <p/>
        <img src="action-definition.png" style="max-width: 843px">
        
        
         
        <p/>
           <aside class="special"><p>The Parameter Name given here must match <b>exactly</b> the name of the parameter defined in the Deployment</p></aside>
         <p/>
       <p/>
 
<p></p> 
        
     
      </google-codelab-step>
      
      
      
      
      <google-codelab-step label="Making Process Logic Context-Sensitive" duration="2">
        
          
          Now there is a variable in the Process whose value will depend on the Group of the user (normally, this means
          the geographical location).
          <p/>
          You can use the value just as with any other - you can display it to the user, or, more usually, you might want
          to define and use a condition which depends on the value.
          <p/>
        
        <h2>Define a  Condition based on the Context Variable value</h2>
        
        <p/>
          <ul>
              <li>Select to define a FIELD condition</li>
            <li>Select the Context Variable</li>
              <li>Define a comparison</li>
          </ul>
        <p/>
        <img src="raincoat-needed.png" style="max-width: 600px">
        
        
       
       <p/>
          Now you can use this condition as a precondition, or in defining other meta-conditions.
          <p/>
          Your app is now able to perform different calculations or offer different advice, depending  on the location of the user!
